![Folder Structure](./img/folder_structure.png)

2. when we run `npm start` , then start script runs in package.json file .
```javascript
"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
```
